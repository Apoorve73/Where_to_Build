# Where_to_Build
This project is made as a part of RoboHack1.0 organized by AmuRoboclub.

### This aims at providing Government authoriities of a city to get the best place to open a Healthcare Service.
In this project we aim to build new health centers at places where there is a lack of medical services using dynamic mapping system.
The tools that we have used so far are data-mining , webscraping , python3(for making our base code run) etc.
An overview of project:
Opening temporary or permanent medical centers at correct places for now is the basic aim so that for any sort of treatment no one has to travel long distances and can be cured at nearby places itself and medical services can reach to large number of people at same time.
In this project , we have used a dynamic map of sample city (name_of_city_here) . In this map using data-mining we aquired locations of different places classified in below three categories:
1. Already equipped with hospitals : Marked with ____
2. Population density regions : Marked with ____
3. Bare plots :Marked with ____

Next, for sample we extracted coordinates of these marked places in order to calculate a rough distance between them and stored them all in a csv file(we will be representing two csv files).
This is to give us an idea to make travelling less.

Now , using the algorith
