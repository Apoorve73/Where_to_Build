# Where_to_Build
In this project we ***aim*** to build **new health centers** at places where there is a **lack of medical services** using a **dynamic mapping** system. The ***tools*** that we have used so far are **web scraping** , **python3**(for making our base code run).Website is constructed using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Flask(_WTForms,_Bootstrap,etc.), SQLAlchemy and Sqlite(as database for login information)**. 
The **coronavirus pandemic** has shown us all in just a few days how fragile our way of life really is. Basic certainties about our health, that of our loved ones and our normal way of life can no longer be taken for granted.Opening temporary or permanent **medical centers at the right place** for now is the basic aim so that for any sort of treatment no one has to travel long distances and can be cured at nearby places itself and medical services can reach a large number of people at same time.
