# Where_to_Build
In this project we ***aim*** to build **new health centers** at places where there is a **lack of medical services** using a **dynamic mapping** system. The ***tools*** that we have used so far are **web scraping** , **python3**(for making our base code run).Website is constructed using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Flask(_WTForms,_Bootstrap,etc.), SQLAlchemy and Sqlite(as database for login information)**. 
The **coronavirus pandemic** has shown us all in just a few days how fragile our way of life really is. Basic certainties about our health, that of our loved ones and our normal way of life can no longer be taken for granted.Opening temporary or permanent **medical centers at the right place** for now is the basic aim so that for any sort of treatment no one has to travel long distances and can be cured at nearby places itself and medical services can reach a large number of people at same time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Install [python3(latest version)](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/) from the links.

**Direct installation of dependencies**
> 1. After cloning repository, head to the directory for *requirements.txt*.
> 2. Run the following command in terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`>

### Usage

Once done with the project setup, open the project in an [**IDE**](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments); for example - [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), etc.


***NOTE : Be sure to select appropriate interpreter. Sometimes it may get deselected.***

*  ### From Command Line Interface
* Head to the project directory conteining ```main.py```

* Open Terminal(Mac/Linux)/Command Prompt there.

* Follow accordingly :arrow_down:

  1. **Unix Bash (Linux, Mac, etc.):**
  ```
  $ export FLASK_APP=main/py
  $ flask run
  ```
  2. **Windows CMD:**
  ```
  > set FLASK_APP=main.py
  > flask run
  ```
  3. **Windows PowerShell:**
   ```
  > $env:FLASK_APP = "1"
  > flask run
  ```
* ### Output:
```
 $ flask run
 Serving Flask app "hello"
 Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

 * Copy `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and open it in a browser and Voila!
 
 * For Quick Demo, click on `Get Demo Here` tab.
